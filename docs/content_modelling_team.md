# Content Modelling

The aim of the Content Modelling team is to:

> ... enable a single source of content truth, using modelled content across documents and channels, to promote
> efficiency and accuracy

Within publishing, we do this via the Content Block Manager and
functionality within Publishing API to process embed codes, which allow content to be embedded in documents and
automatically update when the block changes.
